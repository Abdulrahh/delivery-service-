class project 
Design a Canteen Ordering System where a client can see a menu of food with their prices.
The client can do the following:
Make a new order: the system should take the order from the client, save it using appropriate data structure and calculate the final price for later payment.
 Add more food to his/ her order, where the system can access the old order to add new food and update the price accordingly.
Ask for a check where the system can provide the client with a receipt showing the list of the food with the price of each type of food and the final price.
